??? info "Minimum Requirements"

    While the resource requirements for [Flox][flox] will vary based on the
    software you install, we recommend a minimum of 4Gb of memory and 8Gb of
    storage to install most software.

    Minimum requirements for running installed software is not effected
    by [Flox][flox].

??? info "Existing Nix installations"

    Use the Flox installer for your system to allow some opinionated configuration of Nix, or use the "Nix - Generic" instructions for full control of your Nix installation.

=== "Debian"

    For use on Debian, Ubuntu, and other Debian-based distributions.

    **Download and install the package**

    !!! note "Note"
        The package will register a new source in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d` to enable upgrades via `apt`.

    1. Download flox.deb for your system architecture:

         [64-bit Intel/AMD][flox_x86_64_deb_install]{:target="_blank" .md-button .md-button--primary}
         [64-bit ARM][flox_aarch64_deb_install]{:target="_blank" .md-button .md-button--primary}

    1. Install the downloaded file

        ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
        sudo dpkg -i /path/to/flox.deb
        ```

    **Verify Flox installation**

    If the following command returns without error then you're ready to get
    started!

    ``` console
    $ flox --version # (1)!
    {{ FLOX_VERSION }}

    ```

    1.  The version you will see might be different.

=== "RPM"

    For use on RedHat, CentOS, Amazon Linux, and other RPM-based distributions.

    !!! note "Note"
        The rpm will register a package repository in `/etc/yum.repos.d` to enable upgrades.
        via `yum`, `dnf` and other compatible tools.

    **Download and install the package**

    1. Download flox.rpm for your system architecture:

         [64-bit Intel/AMD][flox_x86_64_rpm_install]{:target="_blank" .md-button .md-button--primary}
         [64-bit ARM][flox_aarch64_rpm_install]{:target="_blank" .md-button .md-button--primary}

    1. Install the downloaded file

        ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
        sudo rpm --import https://downloads.flox.dev/by-env/stable/rpm/flox-archive-keyring.asc
        sudo rpm -ivh /path/to/flox.rpm
        ```

    ??? info "Replacing an existing Nix installation"

        The Flox installer will perform some opinionated configuration of Nix, but Nix will still be usable.    
        If you want full control of your Nix installation, see the instructions for installing Flox in the "Nix - Generic" tab above.

        When installing over a previous installation of Nix the Flox installation
        will:

        1. Back out customizations made to the following files when Nix was
            installed:
            * `/etc/bashrc`
            * `/etc/bash.bashrc`
            * `/etc/profile.d/nix.sh`
            * `/etc/zshrc`
            * `/etc/zsh/zshrc`
        1. Overwrite the system-wide `/etc/nix/nix.conf`
        1. (If applicable) convert the Nix installation to a multi-user install
        1. Reconfigure the `nix-daemon` invocation

        These changes are designed to improve the overall user experience and make the Nix installation more reliable and easier to support, but it's worth noting that **anyone wishing to revert to a "vanilla" Nix installation after installing Flox will need to re-install Nix**.

        If you are installing over a previous installation of Nix we suggest that you install Flox to a test machine or VM to gain familiarity with it first.

    **Verify Flox installation**

    If the following command returns without error then you're ready to get
    started!

    ``` console
    $ flox --version # (1)!
    {{ FLOX_VERSION }}

    ```

=== "Nix - Generic"

    **Install Nix**

    Please ensure you are using Nix version `2.18.0` or greater.

    **Install Flox with Nix imperatively**

    * Configure Substituters

        Add the following values to `/etc/nix/nix.conf`, taking care to merge them
        with any `trusted-substituters` or `trusted-public-keys` values that may
        already be defined:

        ``` title="/etc/nix/nix.conf"
        extra-trusted-substituters = https://cache.flox.dev
        extra-trusted-public-keys = {{ FLOX_PUBLIC_KEY }}
        ```

        Then restart the `nix-daemon`, if applicable:

        * Linux:
            ``` { .text .code-command .copy-2 }
            sudo systemctl stop nix-daemon.service
            sudo systemctl restart nix-daemon.socket
            ```
        * MacOS:
            ``` { .text .code-command .copy-2 }
            sudo launchctl kickstart -k -p system/org.nixos.nix-daemon
            ```

    * Install Flox to your _personal_ profile:

        ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
        nix profile install \
              --experimental-features "nix-command flakes" \
              --accept-flake-config \
              'github:flox/flox'
        ```

    * Install Flox to the system-wide `default` profile as root:

        ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
        sudo -H nix profile install \
              --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/default \
              --experimental-features "nix-command flakes" \
              --accept-flake-config \
              'github:flox/flox'
        ```
    ??? info "On error"

        If you encounter the following error then please upgrade your Nix
        installation (and in particular the running `nix-daemon`) to the latest
        version (minimum supported version is `2.18.0`):

        ```text
        error: builder for '/nix/store/35l1qqyis11y88ic0cp3yxgv3286l4pb-flox-0.0.2-r295.drv' failed with exit code 1;
               last 1 log lines:
               > error: attribute 'requisites' missing
        ```

        If you encounter any other errors with the installer please report the
        bug by way of [discourse][flox_discourse]{:target="_blank"}, including
        a full copy of the command invoked and error encountered.


    **Install Flox with Nix declaratively**

    The following example is for a Nix darwin installation. 
    You may need to modify inputs to match your system.

    ??? info "Using Flox's binary cache"

        Flox hosts a binary cache for its packages, that can be added to your `/etc/nix/nix.conf` file.
        We recommend doing this if you are installing Flox system-wide.

        ``` title="/etc/nix/nix.conf"
        extra-trusted-substituters = https://cache.flox.dev
        extra-trusted-public-keys = {{ FLOX_PUBLIC_KEY }}
        ```

        Or, to your flake configuration by using the `nixConfig` attribute.
        This will ensure that Flox's binary cache is used for all operation within that flake.

        ```title="flake.nix"
        {
            nixConfig = {
                extra-trusted-substituters = ["https://cache.flox.dev"];
                extra-trusted-public-keys = ["flox-cache-public-1:7F4OyH7ZCnFhcze3fJdfyXYLQw/aV7GEed86nQ7IsOs="];
            };
        }
        ```

        Note that if you don't add either of these options, Flox will be built from source, together with a patched version of Nix.
        Which might take a while on less powerful systems.

    ``` { .text .code-command .copy}
    {
      decription = "Example Darwin system flake";

      nixConfig = {
        extra-trusted-substituters = ["https://cache.flox.dev"];
        extra-trusted-public-keys = ["flox-cache-public-1:7F4OyH7ZCnFhcze3fJdfyXYLQw/aV7GEed86nQ7IsOs="];
      };

      inputs = {
        nixpkgs = {
          url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixpkgs-23.11-darwin";
        };
        nix-darwin = {
          url = "github:LnL7/nix-darwin";
          inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
        };
        flox = {
          url = "github:flox/flox/v{{ FLOX_VERSION }}";
        };
      };

      outputs = inputs@{ self, nix-darwin, nixpkgs, flox }:
      let
        configuration = { pkgs, ... }: {
          environment.systemPackages =
            [ pkgs.{{ YOUR_PACKAGES }}
              inputs.flox.packages.${pkgs.system}.default
            ];

          nix.settings = {
            experimental-features = "nix-command flakes";
            substituters = [
              "https://cache.flox.dev"
            ];
            trusted-public-keys = [
              "flox-cache-public-1:7F4OyH7ZCnFhcze3fJdfyXYLQw/aV7GEed86nQ7IsOs="
            ];
          };

          {{ YOUR_CONFIG }}
        };
      in
      {
        darwinConfigurations."{{ YOUR_HOST }}" = nix-darwin.lib.darwinSystem {
          modules = [ configuration ];
          specialArgs = { inherit inputs; };
        };
      };
    }

    ```

    Run `nix-darwin` to install the configuration and packages you’ve declared. 
    This is an example on `nix-darwin`: `nix run nix-darwin -- switch --flake ~/path/to/flake`

    **Verify Flox installation**

    If the following command returns without error then you're ready to get
    started!

    ``` console
    $ flox --version # (1)!
    {{ FLOX_VERSION }}

    ```

    1.  The version you will see might be different.

=== "Nix - NixOS"

    **Configure Substituters**

    Similarly configure `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` to add the lines:

    ``` text title="/etc/nixos/configuration.nix"
    nix.settings.trusted-substituters = [ "https://cache.flox.dev" ];
    nix.settings.trusted-public-keys = [ "{{ FLOX_PUBLIC_KEY }}" ];
    ```

    ... and then invoke:

    ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
    sudo nixos-rebuild switch
    ```

    **Install Flox**

    * Install to your _personal_ profile:

        ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
        nix profile install \
              --experimental-features "nix-command flakes" \
              --accept-flake-config \
              'github:flox/flox'
        ```

    * Install Flox to the system-wide `default` profile as root:

        ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
        sudo -H nix profile install \
              --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/default \
              --experimental-features "nix-command flakes" \
              --accept-flake-config \
              'github:flox/flox'
        ```

    ??? info "On error"

        If you encounter the following error then please upgrade your Nix
        installation (and in particular the running `nix-daemon`) to the latest
        version (minimum supported version is `2.18.0`):

    !!! info "Ignore warning about systemd"

        You will encounter the following warning during the installation:

        ```text
        ---- warning! ------------------------------------------------------------------
        We did not detect systemd on your system. With a multi-user install
        without systemd you will have to manually configure your init system to
        launch the Nix daemon after installation.
        ```

        You can disregard this message as we will be configuring the
        `nix-daemon` to start automatically in the next section.

    **Configure `nix-daemon` to start on activation**

    Once Flox has been installed on your WSL distribution the `nix-daemon` will
    need to be automatically started as you start your WSL instance.

    Run the following command to add the necessary logic to invoke `nix-daemon`
    by way of your `~/.bashrc` file:

    ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
    cat >> ~/.bashrc <<EOF
    ( wsl.exe -d $WSL_DISTRO_NAME -u root service nix-daemon status 2>&1 >/dev/null ) || wsl.exe -d $WSL_DISTRO_NAME -u root service nix-daemon start
    EOF
    ```

    Then restart your WSL shell (or start another) and run the following
    command to ensure that the `nix-daemon` is working correctly:

    ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
    nix --extra-experimental-features nix-command store ping
    ```
    **Verify Flox installation**

    If the following command returns without error then you're ready to get
    started!

    ``` console
    $ flox --version # (1)!
    {{ FLOX_VERSION }}

    ```

## Uninstall Flox

While we are sad we see you uninstalling `flox` we would like **thank you**
for giving `flox` a try.

As we try to improve `flox` we really appreciate any feedback, especially
where we failed. We like to know what was not working or where could we do
a better job. If you can, please reach us [via
discourse][flox_discourse]{:target="_blank"} or [via
email](mailto:hello@floxdev.com).

=== "WSL"

    Please follow the instructions provided on either the Debian or RPM tab
    (whichever matches the existing Linux Distribution installed with your
    WSL) to uninstall Flox.

=== "MacOS - Pkg"

    !!! warning "The following commands will completely remove Nix and the contents of `/nix/*` from the system."

    Be sure to back up the system and/or extract any important Nix-related
    files and packages before continuing.

    1. Ensure no running processes are using `/nix`.

    1. Run:

        ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
        sudo /usr/local/share/flox/scripts/uninstall
        ```

    Regardless of the current state, brew can be used to perform a full clean up:
    ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
    brew uninstall --force --zap flox
    ```

    We recommend rebooting your system after uninstalling Flox.
=== "MacOS - Homebrew"

    !!! warning "The following commands will completely remove Nix and the contents of `/nix/*` from the system."

    Be sure to back up the system and/or extract any important Nix-related
    files and packages before continuing.

    !!! note "You may be asked if the terminal has permission to modify contents of the disk."

    Run:

    ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
    brew uninstall flox
    ```

    To remove all traces of flox including user preferences uninstall with:

    ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
    brew uninstall --zap flox
    ```

    In the case of recovering a partial install, a force and zap can help:
    ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
    brew uninstall --force --zap flox
    ```

    We recommend rebooting your system after uninstalling Flox.

=== "Nix/Generic"

    If you've installed flox to the system-wide `default` profile

    ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
    sudo -H nix profile remove \
            '.*flox' \
            --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/default \
            --experimental-features "nix-command flakes"
    ```

    Or, if you've installed flox to your own _personal_ profile

    ``` { .text .code-command .copy }
    nix profile remove \
            '.*flox' \
            --experimental-features "nix-command flakes"
    ```

    Or, if you've declared Flox using a flake, remove the Flake
