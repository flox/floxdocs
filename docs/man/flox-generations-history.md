environment

## SYNOPSIS

    flox [<general-options>] generations history
         [-d=<path> | -r=<owner/name>]

For environments pushed to FloxHub, every modification to the

possible to change the current generation by using
`flox generations switch` or `flox generations rollback`.

`flox generations history` prints what generation has been the current
generation over time.

environment in the current directory or the active environment that was
last activated is used.

`-d`, `--dir`  
Path containing a .flox/ directory.

`-r`, `--remote`  
A remote environment on FloxHub, specified in the form `<owner>/<name>`.

### General Options

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand
but must be specified *before* the subcommand.

`-v`, `--verbose`  
Increase logging verbosity. Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.
