# `flox build` command

## NAME

flox-build - Build packages with Flox

## SYNOPSIS

    flox [<general-options>] build
         [-d=<path>]
         [--stability <stability>]
         [<package>]...

## DESCRIPTION

Build the specified `<package>` from the environment in `<path>`, and
the output at `result-<package>` adjacent to the environment.

### Manifest-defined packages

Possible values for `<package>` are all keys under the `build` attribute
in the `manifest.toml`. If no `<package>` is specified, Flox will
attempt to build all packages that are defined in the `manifest.toml`.

Packages are built by running the script defined in
`build.<package>.command` within a `bash` subshell. The shell will
behave as if `flox activate` was run immediately prior to running the
build script.

#### Pure and impure builds

Builds can be performed in a sandbox for the sake of reproducibility. By
default this sandbox is turned off and the build is run in the root of
the repository. This allows you to perform incremental builds using
existing caches and intermediate build artifacts. We call this an
“impure” build. With the sandbox disabled, building is similar to
running the build script manually within a shell created by
`flox activate`.

Pure builds are run in a temporary directory with the sandbox enabled.
The sandbox can be enabled by setting
`build.<package>.sandbox = "pure"`. Only files tracked by `git` are
copied into the temporary build directory. This ensures that the build
doesn’t accidentally depend on untracked files.

For this kind of “sandboxed” build, access to untracked files and files
outside of the repository are restricted to provide a reproducible build
environment. Sandboxed builds on Linux additionally are restricted from
accessing the network, but the sandboxing mechanisms on macOS are
somewhat limited and thus pure builds on macOS *will be able to access
the network*.

#### Referring to other builds

Any build can access the *results* of other builds (including
non-sandboxed ones) by referring to their name via `${<package>}`. This
allows multi-stage builds. In the example below, the `app` package
depends on the `dep` package by using `${deps}/node_modules`.

#### Build outputs

`flox build` creates a temporary directory for the build script to
output built packages to. The environment variable `out` is set to this
directory, and the build script is expected to copy or move packages to
`$out`.

Upon completion of the build, the build result will be symlinked to
`result-<package>` adjacent to the `.flox` directory that defines the
package.

#### Metadata

Specifying the `build.<package>.description>` and
`build.<package>.version` fields of the build provide extra metadata
that can be used by `flox install`, `flox search`, and `flox show`
commands if the build is later published.

The `build.<package>.version` field can be specified in one of the
following ways:

1.  **as a string**: `version = "0.0.1"`
2.  **as read from a file**: `version.file = "<path>"`
3.  **as returned by a command**: `version.command = "<cmd> <args>"`

## OPTIONS

`<package>`  
The package(s) to build. Possible values are all keys under the `build`
attribute in the environment’s `manifest.toml`.

`--stability <stability>`  
Perform a nix expression build using a base package set of the given
stability as tracked by the catalog server. Can not be used with
manifest base builds.

### Environment Options

If no environment is specified for an environment command, the
environment in the current directory or the active environment that was
last activated is used.

`-d`, `--dir`  
Path containing a .flox/ directory.

### General Options

`-h`, `--help`  
Prints help information.

The following options can be passed when running any `flox` subcommand
but must be specified *before* the subcommand.

`-v`, `--verbose`  
Increase logging verbosity. Invoke multiple times for increasing detail.

`-q`, `--quiet`  
Silence logs except for errors.

## EXAMPLES

### Building a simple pure package

1.  Add build instructions to the manifest:

``` toml
## file: .flox/env/manifest.toml

...
[build]
hello.command = '''
## produce something and move it to $out
mkdir -p $out
echo "hello world" >> $out/hello.txt
'''
description = "Produces a file containing 'hello world'"
version = "0.0.0"
```

2.  Build the package and verify its contents:

<!-- -->

    $ flox build hello
    $ ls ./result-hello
    hello.txt
    $ cat ./result-hello/hello.txt
    hello, world

### Building a simple multi-stage app

Assume a simple `nodejs` project

    .
    ├── .git/
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    ├── public/
    ├── README.md
    ├── src/
    ...

1.  Initialize a Flox environment

``` shell
$ flox init
```

2.  Install dependencies and add build instructions

``` toml
## file: .flox/env/manifest.toml
version = 1

[install]
nodejs.pkg-path = "nodejs"
rsync.pkg-path = "rsync"

## install node dependencies using npm
## disable the sandbox to allow access to the network
[build]
deps.command = '''
npm ci
mkdir -p $out
mv node_modules $out/node_modules
'''
deps.sandbox = "off"

## build the application using previously fetched dependencies
app.command = '''
rsync -lr ${deps}/node_modules ./
npm run build
mv dist $out/
'''
```

3.  Verify the result

``` shell
$ npx serve result-app
```
