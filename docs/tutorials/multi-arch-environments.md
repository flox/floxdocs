# Designing multiple architecture environments

Flox makes it simple to have the **same [environment][environment_concept] on
multiple systems and CPU architectures**.
This guide walks through an example between two coworkers who have different
system types,
and shows how to customize your environment with system-specific dependencies.

## Creating an environment

To get started,
let's create an [environment][environment_concept] from a Linux laptop.
This laptop is using an ARM CPU (aarch64) which makes its full system
type `aarch64-linux`.

When using [`flox search`][flox_search] you may see packages that won't immediately work with your manifest, but finding and allowing system specific packages is very easy.
Flox shows software from the following systems: `aarch64-darwin`, `x86_64-darwin`, `aarch64-linux`, and `x86_64-linux`.

Some packages may support only a subset of system types. You can inspect a
package with [`flox show`][flox_show] to see what system types are supported:

```console
$ flox show gdb
gdb - The GNU Project debugger
    gdb@14.2 (aarch64-linux, x86_64-darwin, x86_64-linux only)
    gdb@14.1 (aarch64-linux, x86_64-darwin, x86_64-linux only)
    gdb@13.2 (aarch64-linux, x86_64-darwin, x86_64-linux only)
    gdb@13.1 (aarch64-linux, x86_64-darwin, x86_64-linux only)
...
```

First let's install some packages to our environment running on Linux:

``` console
$ flox init --name eng-team-tools
✨ Created environment eng-team-tools (aarch64-linux)
...
$ flox install gnupg vim
✅ 'gnupg' installed to environment eng-team-tools at /home/youruser
✅ 'vim' installed to environment eng-team-tools at /home/youruser
```

To make it easy to share this system across platforms we are going to share it
on FloxHub with [`flox push`][flox_push].

``` console
$ flox push
✅  eng-team-tools successfully pushed to FloxHub

    Use 'flox pull youruser/eng-team-tools' to get this environment in any other location.
```

Learn more about this and other sharing options in the
[sharing environments guide][sharing_guide].

## Using the environment from a different system type

Many packages in Flox will work without any issue across system types.

To test this out, run [`flox pull`][flox_pull] from another system such as an
Apple machine with an M-series processor.
This system type is `aarch64-darwin`.
Then lets run the a simple `gpg --version` command to test everything is working.

``` console
$ flox pull youruser/eng-team-tools
✨  Pulled youruser/eng-team-tools from https://hub.flox.dev

    You can activate this environment with 'flox activate'
$ flox activate -- gpg --version
gpg (GnuPG) 2.4.5
libgcrypt 1.10.3
Copyright (C) 2024 g10 Code GmbH
...
```

Looks like the environment works cross-platform, nice!

## Handling unsupported packages

However, some packages only work with a subset of systems.
To demonstrate this let's install a package that **isn't compatible with an Apple machine** and set a system-specific option for these packages.

From the Linux machine...

``` console
$ flox install systemd # (1)!
❌ ERROR: resolution failed: package 'systemd' not available for
    - aarch64-darwin
    - x86_64-darwin
  but it is available for
    - aarch64-linux
    - x86_64-linux
```

1. `systemd` is only available on Linux systems

To install `systemd` for compatible systems, [`flox edit`][flox_edit] the [manifest][manifest_toml].

``` console
$ flox edit
```

We will **add systemd** and include its `systems` attribute to filter only for
the supported systems.

``` toml title="manifest.toml"
[install]
...
gnupg.pkg-path = "gnupg" # (1)!
vim.pkg-path = "vim"

systemd.pkg-path = "systemd" # (2)!
systemd.systems = ["aarch64-linux", "x86_64-linux"] # (3)!
```

1. These packages were installed using `flox install` earlier.
2. Here we are declaring a new installation, `systemd`.
3. To allow non-Linux users to use this environment, the system attribute filters for just Linux systems.

With the edits complete, save and quit your editor.
The environment should update successfully!

``` console
$ flox edit
✅ Environment successfully updated.
```

Finally, we can push this update so we can list packages from the Apple machine
to verify everything works.

``` console
$ flox push
✅  Updates to eng-team-tools successfully pushed to FloxHub

    Use 'flox pull youruser/eng-team-tools' to get this environment in any other location.
```

Then, from the Apple machine, lets pull the latest.

``` console
$ flox pull
✅ Pulled ghudgins/default from https://hub.flox.dev/

You can activate this environment with 'flox activate' 
$ flox list
gnupg: gnupg (2.4.5)
vim: vim (9.1.0377)
$ flox list -c
...
[install]
gnupg.pkg-path = "gnupg"
vim.pkg-path = "vim"
systemd.pkg-path = "systemd"
systemd.systems = ["aarch64-linux"]
...
```

The Apple machine does not have `systemd` despite it appearing in the manifest.
This environment will activate on both machines and the Apple machine won't
get the `systemd` package.
