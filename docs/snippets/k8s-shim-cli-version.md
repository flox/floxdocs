## Flox CLI Version

The installation procedure described here will install the latest version of the Flox CLI that is available when the nodes are created.
This means that in order to upgrade the Flox CLI you must bring up new nodes and bring down the old nodes.
Conversely, this also means that any time you replace a node you may update the installed version of the Flox CLI.
